PCB:
- Double sided PCBs
- Tracks have to be bigger

Case: 
- Production start at end of stage one
- Software: Frontplattendesigner by schäffer
- Format: Maybe DXF

Problem:
- Reiter doesn´t know what risks we are going to take. We have to make clear what the prioritys of the Work packages are. 

Ordering Parts:
- Velostat foil
- female plugs to connect pcb to external hardware (MIDI, Potis, Pads)
- Schrumpfschläuche

further progress:
- delay of Case Design
- Focus on Memory Class
- Draw.IO for Flow Chart
- Memory class needs to provide a easy and structured file system
- we need to access the bottom of the teensy
- finding a solution for the bottom Pins of the teensy
